## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within this project, please follow these steps:

1.  **Do NOT open a public issue.** Publicly reporting a vulnerability can put users at risk.
2.  **Report via GitHub**: Please use the [GitHub Security Advisories](https://github.com/Raoof128/MTIA/security/advisories) feature to privately report vulnerabilities.
3.  **Include details**: Please include as much information as possible, such as:
    *   Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, XSS)
    *   Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
    *   The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
    *   Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
    *   Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
    *   Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
    *   Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

## Response Timeline

*   We will acknowledge receipt of your report within 48 hours.
*   We will provide a status update every 5 days until the issue is resolved.
*   Once the issue is resolved, we will publish a security advisory and give credit to the reporter (if desired).
